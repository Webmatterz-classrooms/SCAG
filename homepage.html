          All the Championship events will be played to WESPA Rules V5.1 or the
          latest version of the Rules at the time of the championships. Some
          slight variations may apply for the WTSC due to its nature and format,

          championships in the past. However, whatever changes that may apply
          will be communicated to the WESPA Committee well ahead of the WTSC for
          review and approval.
